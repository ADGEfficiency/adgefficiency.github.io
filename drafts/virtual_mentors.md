We would all love to have a hotline to Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk, who could give us personalized advice about how to move forward.  But think about 200 years - wouldn't the ability to have access, on demand, to the talks, lectures and books of the most successful and thoughtful people on the planet be equally as exciting?

One of those you are unlikely to get - the second you have now.

I recently read the book *Reinvent Yourself* which talks about the concept of **virtual mentors**. 

I have been taking notes from the presentations of people I admire for a long time (well before I read Reinvent Yourself).  I usually find older talks are more useful.  Older talks also allow you to single out the key principles that don't change over a persons lifetime.  

Although the advice of a virtual mentor will never be personal, often the great ideas are general enough that they can be applied across industries and across time.

## general observations

There are a few things that are common to all of my virtual mentors.

### a few great ideas 

A great life needs a few great ideas - not every great idea.  Every mentor has around three great ideas that they repeat constantly.  Bezos always talks about building a customer centric company, Musk often talks about the value of first principles thinking and Ray Dailo wrote two books focusing on the value of principles.

There is no pressure to come up with great new ideas every day.  In fact it's far better to find a few ideas and to repeat and refine them.  

So don't be afraid if you are repeating yourself!  Refine your message and use those converations to check that you are right.

## lessons from the mentors

### Linus Torvalds

Linux Torvals has made two massive contributions to the world - the Linux kernel and Git. 
 
**importance of specalization** 
- progress occurs through specalization
- not interested in what he isn't interested in

**the value of iteration**
> I know you don’t hit it on the first generation, don’t think you hit it on the second, on the third generation maybe, on the fourth & fifth, that is when we start talking       

**an anti-visionary**
- looks at the ground rather than at the starts
- execution is more important than vision
- believes in passion
- care about what you do

### Jeff Bezos

The founder and CEO of Amazon.

**innovation requires experimentation**
- if the cost of experiments is high, you won't do them

**focus on what won't change**
- in fast changing industries it's hard to predict the future
- closely following competitors in a fast changing industry won't work

**customer focus**
- customers are never satasified - they pull the company along

**long term focus**
- the quartely results are a result of work done years ago
- sacrifice profits today for profits tomorrow
- the freedom from quarterly profits = allows experimentation with new ideas and loss leading products to get data
- sees the ability to focus long term as a gift - a luxury that many companies don't have

### Ray Dalio

The founder Bridgewater Associates, one of the world's largest hedge funds.

**meaningful work & meaningful relationships**
- fundamental to being human
- our social intelligence is what separates us from other animals

**first, second and third order consequences**
- exercise (1st = pain, 2nd = health)
- they are often opposite

**universal laws are the best way to understand systems**
- laws for specific cases are useful only to see if they align with universal laws

**evolution, growth and learning**
- 5 step process
- clarity from iterating over principles
- key is to fail, learn and improve quickly
- 18 months to change a habit
- pain is the signal that preceeds growth

**transparency and open mindedness enhances the learning feedback loop**
- less self deception, better feedback from others
- your ability to deal with being wrong is more important than what you actually know
- if you change your mind, you are the winner

**evolution is the most powerful force in the universe**
- uses reality/evolution/nature interchangeably
- nature optimizes for the whole
- nature rewards that which contributes towards the evolution of the whole
- Dailo's goal is to evolve and contribute towards evolution
- personal evolution is the reward

**when you disagree with someone, say their opinion back to them and see if they agree**

## Why Buddhism is True


### Elon Musk

Founder and CEO of SpaceX and Tesla.

**cost optimization occurs in two ways**
- one way from the classic economy of scale
- second from iteration over multiple versions and designs
- iterating over designs allows scaling

**probabilistic thinking**
> ...things will most likely be ok for a long time on earth... not for sure but most likely
- fatalism can be helpful - accept the probabilities

**first principles thinking**
- don't reason by analogy
- required if you want to build new things

**be less risk averse when there is less risk**
- i.e. early in life

**the goal of SpaceX is the preservation of conciousness**

**admitting mistakes**
email payments was a small and easy part of PayPal - when they showed the product people were most excited by email payments

### Steve Jobs

Founder and CEO of Apple.

**admit mistakes and adjust**
- changing your mind is a sign of intelligence
- Macintosh with desktop publishing
- neXT targeting Adobe when the value was in custom operational apps
- no third party apps for the iPhone in 2007

**simplicity**
- a few weeks after returning to Apple, got rid of 70% of the future product pipeline

**focusing is about saying no**
- don't invent everything yourself, know the 10-30% you need to invent and use other stuff for the rest
- the eaisest code to write is code you don't write

**everything was made by people no smarter than you are**
- you can change things, build things, improve life
- you need to be willing to fail - the experience is worth the cost of failure

### Jack Diederich
A Python core developer.

**job is hard enough without trying to clever up the place**

**maybe you should try this, what about this**
Always and nevers - this talk doesn’t have them
Instead focus on ‘what would it look like’ or ‘have you thought of this?’

**stop writing classes**
- if you class has two methods, one of which is `__init__` - it shouldn't be a class

**how to write a function**
- define variables when you need them (had to be defined at start of a function)
- use as many returns as you need (complier wanted single return)
- (both of these are holdovers from other langugages!)

### Raymond Hettinger
A Python core developer.

**there must be a better way**
- with Python, there often is
