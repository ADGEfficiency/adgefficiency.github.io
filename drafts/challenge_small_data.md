NOTES

Poor state of digitization means working with small data is the primary work of energy data scientists

Renewables forecasting - because many sites are young (i.e 2 year old wind farm) there wont be a lot of data!  

Ability to combine datasets important, or to be able to generalize!

Differnet set of tools

RL is good because it is a data generation process

Low capacity models

Breakthroughs in convolution (specifically the abililty to not feature engineer) dont necessiarly convert (ie dropout or batch norm, esp batch norm) because we dont have the data
