Become comfortable with imperfection - unfinished projects, messy notebooks, half finished reviews of textbooks, reviews of literature that only focus on the important stuff.  This is 80/20 in action

Be uncomfortable with your past failures and embarassements.  Not because they made you who you are, but because you are not that person anymore.

Leonardo on unfinished projects - quote from Walter isssacson book

Trust your previous self - if you reviewed a book or highlighted sections once , don’t think you need to read it again
Similar to the ideas in gtd of trusting your systems - trust that if you leave a note somewhere you will pick it up later

don’t be afraid if your notes are a mess!  embrace the mess
perfectionism on organising your internal notes is a total waste of time - be proud that you aren’t spending time organising notes for no benefit
and if you are - you aren’t doing the hard things

see a similar thing with handwriting - speed more important than clarity (ideally want it to be written as quickly as possible and just be interpretable)

evolution as a principle (heavily inspired by dailo, see principles)

My Principles - should have a section on each

Compassion 

Compassion and kindness are my guiding moral principles.

As to methods, there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who grasps principles can successfully select his own methods - RALPH WALDO EMERSON

The practice of compassion and kindness is unlimited and never finished.  Morality - or how we move through the world - will always be our greatest challenge and one we can always improve at.  Cultivating compassion towards others is difficult.  Even more challenging is being compassionate to yourself.   Not just your current self - your past and previous self.  In a way it’s easier to be compassionate towards a homeless man on the street than your previous self.  

This acknowledgement of your previous self as someone who deserves your compassion today is also a recognition of the idea of no-self - the you of yesterday is not the you of today.  

By separating your identification with your previous self, you allow yourself to be more compassionate towards the person who got you where you are today.

It’s not only yourself and other humans who deserve your compassion and kindness.  

*** puts it better than I ever could:
"Over the last two centuries tens of billions of them have been subjected to a regime of industrial exploitation whose cruelty has no precedent in the annals of planet Earth. If we accept a mere tenth of what animal-rights activists are claiming, then modern industrial agriculture might well be the greatest crime in history. When evaluating global happiness, it is wrong to count the happiness only of the upper classes, of Europeans or of men. Perhaps it is also wrong to consider only the happiness of humans."

Impermanence
Impermanence is a characteristic of reality.

No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man - HERACLITUS

Things always change. There isn’t a single thing I’ve come across that has always been, has never changed or will last forever.  The implications of this are significant when we turn inside and look at how everything we use to define ourselves constantly changes.  You don’t exist as an inherent & unchanging actor in the world.  

Yet even without considering what impermanence means for the ‘you’ that you treat as inherently existing from it’s own side, the constantly changing nature of the world we live in means that you need to change.  Change is unavoidable.  Intentional change is however not guaranteed.  

This is seen clearly in the learning process of a reinforcement learning agent.  The learning process is non-stationary and stochastic.  

The processes of intentional reinvention can be seen in the musical careers of both Neil Young and Bob Dylan.  Both reinvented themselves multiple times over their careers.  It’s something I’ve already done professionally (see Take * and add AI)

Neuroplasticity exists along the same lines.   The ability of brain matter to be purposed and repurposed towards whatever we use it for is an example of how even the structure of our own brains can and does change over time.  

Ray Dalio shares this view (highlighted on kindle***)

no self
page 183 of Principles (dalio) (search for the brain battles) - 

also stuff from buddhism is true

the struggle between thinking and feeling

Gratitude is the best solution to the human condition
Another Buddhist idea is that of dukkha - often translated as suffering but I think more accurately translated as unsatisfactoriness.  The Buddha taught that this (along with impermanence and no-self) is a characteristic of human existence.  It’s a truth about how the human being views the world.  

In our untrained condition we are never satisfied.  There always exists a longing or desire for things to be better.   

One antidote to this is the deliberate practice of gratitude.  You live in one of the most peaceful times in human history.  You have access to more knowledge than almost every great philosopher.  You have probably never gone a day without drinking water or eating.  Be grateful for these things.  Actually writing these down will calm your natural inclination to want a better job or nicer flat.  

Take * and add AI
This is advice often given to entrepreneurs - take an industry and use generalisable learning to improve it.  But it also applies on an individual career level. 

Take an industry you understand and add the power of generalisable machine learning algorithms to it. 

Only four years into my career as an energy engineer I realized that the progress we are seeing in machine learning can solve problems in the energy industry.  This idea evolved into a professional mission - to use machine learning to fight climate change.  

This combination of domain knowledge with the power of generalizable learners makes you a rare and valuable.  The combination of an understanding of both a specific industry and machine learning could be rarer than an equal level of understanding either/or.  It would be industry dependent - many machine learning engineers would have an excellent understanding of software development, but perhaps not as many would understand how clean water is produced.  

Conditional probability (!) kind of ***

The machine learning world is also a fantastic one to work in.  Almost all literature is freely available, world class tools are all open source and getting help requires only being able to use Google.

Open source tools means not only you can use them for free, but you can dig down into the code and see how they work.  For getting an education on how to write machine learning code, nothing is better than looking at how other people do it.  

Compare this to energy where almost all literature is behind a paywall, the tools you use are expensive, locked down and opaque and knowledge largely exists in the heads of experienced engineers.  It’s a much more difficult environment to work in. 

Politics ***
The dilemmas in politics are simple:
Tax more = less efficient economy, more equity
Tax less = more efficient, less equal

Permanent growth is stupid.  Both in terms of population and economic growth.  Our inability to stop the former and our lack of ability to stop obsessing over the latter are massive problems.  

We won’t solve climate change
Aligning myself with a professional mission (to use machine learning to solve climate change) helps to focus my work and keep me motivated.  Yet I strongly believe we won’t solve climate change.  

We have known about the warming effects of greenhouse gases for well over *** years.  There have been impotent and ineffective political movements to fix the problem for over ***.  There is no reason to expect this won’t continue.  It’s not like all of a sudden as a civilization we will wake up and start to sovle the problems.  Instead what will happen is circuses like Paris (which has no binding targets and no penalties for not reaching them) where we achieve nothing.  

To demonstrate the insanity of the human animal.  All around Miami they now require constant pumping of water to deal with rising sea levels.  These pumps are driven using fossil fuel generated electricity.  So even in our process to adapt to the effects of climate change we are causing more of it.  

We are a product of evolution.  Evolution has not prepared us for a challenge like climate change.  Our brains are not able to understand the ramifications of long term change.  The human animal just does not think like this.  

It’s actually something I’ve become strangely comforable with.  If as an animal we aren’t fit to take care of our planet, then we don’t deserve it.  It’s a tragedy - not so much for us but for the billions of animals that also inhabit this planet.  The cruelty of sudden changes in climate on animals who can have no way of either understanding or stopping whats happening is the most tragic aspect of climate change.  

It’s not the effect on us.  Humanity will survive - we will cling on in the barren wastelands of a planet that we will inhabit in the future.  

This might sound negative - it is however realistic.  The truth about climate change and our lack of a response to solving it is a reality.  Hiding away from it is the reaction of the most people - and also one of the causes of climate change in the first place.  

Evolution is not a linear process
One of the most interesting parts of Ray Dalio’s book Principles was the picture of evolution not as a process of constant improvement but one of periods of growth and and decline.  

In any sort of sequential process (a project at work, personal growth etc) things will not slowly improve.  They will get better, then worse, then better.  Be ready to accept this.  Especially in the realm of self improvement, getting upset by small problems can easily lead to a response that throws out all the gains you have made.  For example, you will slip up on a diet.  Accept it and continue on - don’t throw out the whole diet because of one unskillful afternoon!  

Don’t be attached to the results of your work
This is an idea that goes all the way back to the Bhavagahad Gita.  ***

Also why I don’t care if no one reads my blog (post the stats!!!).  

Blogging will revolutionize your career - but you won’t do it
For me starting a blog has been the best career move I’ve ever made.  It’s advice I’ve given to a lot of people - no one has taken it.

A really valuable attitude to take to blogging is to appreciate the massive benefits that don’t rely on having an audience.  The process of improving your domain knowledge and improving your writing makes the time spent worthwhile.  Any additional benefits that come from people reading your work only add to an already paid back cost.  

You won’t get the same benefit from writing and not making it public.  You will care a lot more about it if someone could read it.  But even if no one did, the time spent learning about whoever you are blogging about the improvement in your ability to write will make the effort worth it.  

Thats not to say that your audience won’t benefit you.  I’ve made incredibly high contacts through my blog - far higher than I ever did standing in a room of strangers after a lecture or talk.  It’s far easier to show people you have a certain level of understanding if you make your work public.  It’s very difficult to do this in a room full of strangers in 5 minutes.  

This same idea applies to open source projects.  Because your work is public you end up taking much more care with it.  

Don’t expect every book you read or event you attend to revolutionise your life
I often attend meet ups that are disappointing.  Yet one relevant talk can make three or four evenings all worth it.  It’s important to keep this in mind.  If you expect every lecture, business meeting or meet up to change your life, you will be constantly disappointed.  

The same applies to books - not every book you read will change your life.  Not every page in a great book will change your life.  But the few pages in those few books will make reading any number of books worth it.  

Yet a book offers some advantages over attending lectures - it can be skim read and more importantly can be read multiple times.  

Single pointed focus on a single project is the ideal 
But it’s not always possible.  Sometimes you might need to work on two projects in a day - this is unavoidable.  But if you can manage it, a single day on one project can be very rewarding.

Working from home is a skill
I am lucky enough to be employed by a modern and forward thinking startup.  There exists a level of trust where employees can easily be given flexibility of where and how they work.  It’s a modern approach based on what work gets done, not hours spent working.  

I often hear “I could never work from home”.  That might be true now - but you can learn how to do this.  You are talking about the potential to remove the cost (time and money) of commuting.  It will take time to adjust but the upside is pretty high.  

I do feel like the remote working revolution could actually be a significant boost of productivity for the economy.  A combination of improved productivity and reduced transportation costs could add up to a significant producitivty improvement.  

Evolution makes good use of allowing many parallel experiments.  If we recognise that people are different, giving them the ability to 

Work 7 days a week
An interesting consequence of having complete freedom in where I do my work is the flexibility to experiment with how I work.  I prefer to spread the same amount of hours across the entire week.  One of the benefits of this approach is to take advantage of the work your subconscious does when you are asleep.  Even working for a single conscious hour on one day is enough to make sure when you go to bed, some of your suboncious will work for you. 

What makes this powerful is the ratio of hours worked to the sum of both your conscious and subconscious effort in understanding.  

As with single pointed focus this is not always possible - but it’s an ideal for me.  

This idea is also in Effective Executive.  A book highly recommended by Tim Feriss and frustratingly only available in paperback form, Drucker notes one dimension of being effective - concentration on whats important. 

Context matters
Sticking with the subconscious.  What our eyes get as input and our consciousness experiences will be different.  Most likely what we experience is a lower dimensional representation of what the environment sends us as input.  This is exactly what a convolutional neural network does - takes a high dimensional array.  This array is often five dimensional - height, width and three colour channels.  A convolutional neural network will take this array and reduce the dimensionality to one we care about - for example classifying the image or creating a caption for the image.  (Maybe draw this??)

Our subconscious however does receive this input - and I believe it uses it.  How then can we refer to ‘our’ subconscious?  We can’t even experience as it sees - only what it allows us to see.  The lack of control is one of the original arguments by the Buddha given in the Cula-Saccaka Sutra.  A parable is made between a King controlling his kingdom versus our inability to control any of the five aggregates (body, feelings, perceptions, thoughts or consciousness).  

Don’t confuse the scope of our attention with the scope of your unconsciousness attention & input.   Your subcinciouness does see the rubbish as you walk down the street.  It can see your messy desk.  Your conscious attention may not notice it but the effect is going into how your body/brain works. 

Medium is the message.  

Walking past a pile of rubbish does matter.  

One example of this is the use of a whiteboard versus paper for thinking.  Technically both offer the same tool - the ability to write and draw.  But you can’t stand back and look at a piece of paper.  This ability to physically interact with the medium you are using is important.  It does change the way you work.  

The value of space and starting again
In 2016 I took 6 months off to travel after 4 years of work.  One of the things that surprised me most about the first few months was the flood of new ideas that filled my brain.  This is the value of space - now that my brain wasn’t spending it’s time thinking about emails, meetings and engineering work it had the space to think about new things.  

Another example of space is the empty page, the empty spreadsheet or the empty script.  Sometimes it’s better to just start from scratch.  You brain just works fundamentally differently when it can start without any constraint.  

My working process has this requirement to start again built in from the start.  I know that the first version will be completely thrown out.  It’s a cost of work - the first few drafts allow you to see what you need to do to structure your approach to a problem.  It’s just not possible to see the pros and cons of different structures before having a go.  It’s usually pretty simple after a second draft to see the broad solution to a problem.  

Along a similar to starting from scratch is the importance of drafting.  No project will be correct the first time.  It usually takes two or three attempts before you can see how to correctly structure something.  This is true in writing and coding.  

Your first draft will be shit.  

It’s really hard to understand how valuable space can be. 

Learning to know how it’s done - not to be able to do it
In my first year as an engineering student we learnt how to do engineering drawing by hand.  Drawing by hand is not something that any modern engineer spends time doing - thats what CAD is for.  

Yet the benefit of learning how to draw by hand wasn’t so that we could draw - it was so that we could understand how drawing was done.  

This is also true for discounted cash flow modelling.  Early in your career, take the time to build a few of these models.  Then later on you can get someone else to do it, but still understanding a) whats going on and b (and maybe more importantly) notice mistakes!  

Going beyond your required level to make your level easy / Practice at a higher level than you play at
Most engineering degrees contain significant amounts of mind bending mathematics.  This maths is beyond what is required in many engineering jobs.  The value in pushing yourself beyond and into the realms of double integrals isn’t to actually be able to do them day to day.  

The value is that going back down to doing algebra or simple calculus (which is actually required day to day as an engineer) becomes very easy.  

What you hate doing might be the most valuable
Two examples of this from my study.  During both my undergrad and masters I absolutely hated programming - its now something I do every day and really enjoy.  The intellectual challenge of programming is one of the purest and rewarding things I do.  

The second came during my masters.  A lot of our course focused on the mathematics behind optimisation algorithms.  Again - I hated it.  Yet applying optimisation to the operation of combined heat and power plants was one of the most profitable things I’ve done in my career.  Gradient based optimisation also forms the basis of the majority of modern machine learning - something which I’m using almost every day. 

The fight against perfect - aka the fight for simplicity
There is nothing more damaging than the quest for perfection.  A few ways in which I try to fight this urge
* When studying or reviewing, don’t feel the need to read every page.  Focus only on what is likely to be relevant. 
* Don’t build for the future - this is especially true with coding.  Things change - wait until you need something to build it into your project.
* Not every project will go somewhere.  My Evernote is littered with half written blog posts and ideas for projects.  You don’t need to finish them all - in fact I think failed and unfinished projects is a sign of the ability to prioritise.  

The pure intellectual nature of programming means the principle of simplicity shines through when writing code.  Simpler code means less to maintain, less that can potentially go wrong and makes your work understandable to others.  Simpler writing follows similar lines.  

Simplicity is also a great principle in terms of what you own.  Owning less is cheaper (both to initially purchase and maintain), reduces your environmental impact and also is one less thing to be attached too.  

Premature optimization = the root of all evil
Premature optimization = mantle sacrifice mantianbility

Don’t be someone who knows something and gets nothing done.  You don’t need to know how everything works.  

It’s so important to be able to intelligently select when to stop learning.  In the *** DeepMind Atari paper they tested one network structure.  They didn’t try out 100 - they knew when what they had was good enough.

Dylan talks about this in that San Fran interview (lots of unrecorded songs).  Kind of like drafting really

Example of doing a process like this.  If I committed to doing this each year, and missed a year, it doesn’t mean I should throw out the whole process.

Also the idea of wanting consistency - sometimes its better if things are less consistent, but better organised!! 

**idea that structure and consistency will strangle you.  ie format for reviews of books.  some books lend themselves to a short summary + long notes, other just long notes etc**

Our psychology was formed by evolution
In Why Buddhism Is True *** talks about how the role of feelings in our life is the way it is because of evolutionary pressure.  

Your brain is a machine.  One of the interesting side effects of using neural networks in my work is to start to appreciate the modular and mechanical nature of our brains.  

One really interesting modern psychological insight is the generative nature of memory.  This has a parallel with a powerful class of machine learning model - the generative adversarial network (GAN).  GANs improve the generative ability of one neural network using ** by a discriminator network.  I’m not suggesting memory is adversarial - but it is certainly generative.  

This psychological reality is shown in The Soprano’s.  Tony often mistakenly recalls events in his life when talking to his psychiatrist (and not just when he is trying to impress her).  

Three of the most popular modern neural structures are feedforward, convolutional and recurrent (specifically the long short term memory (LSTM) implementation).  This implies hat this kind of division of labour occurs within the structure of our own brain.  The alignment of this with the Buddhist idea of no-self is one of the ways in which this ancient idea is worth contemplating.  



Wide versus deep
I’m currently fascinated with this concept.  In life we often need to trade off between the two - trying a number of different things or spending our time with only a few.  

AlphaGo addresses the wide versus deep problem directly.  By using a policy network to reduce the width of next possible actions and a value network to reduce the depth of search, AlphaGo is able to reduce an intractable search space by reducing the width and depth of the search for the optimal action.  

Another reinforcement learning concept that speaks to the wide versus deep idea is the exploration versus exploitation dilemma.  Do we trust what we think we know or do we try something new?  It’s a parameter that needs to be tuned when a reinforcement learning agent tries to understand the environment it’s being born into.  

The wide versus deep concept can illuminate the decisions we made in many different areas of our lives.  Perhaps the most obvious is the decision to travel or to settle down.  

One application I’m interested in currently is in choosing what to read.  The younger you are it makes sense to read widely.  As you grow older and start to get an understanding of what books you enjoy or find useful, it makes sense to read similar books, books by the same author or to actually read those books again.  

We really don’t remember a lot of what we read once.  




One pratical application of this is to choosing what to read.  It makes sense to read more widely when you are younger (as you don’t know what books you like) and then as you get older to focus on the genre or even reread books that you found valuable.  The lessons in a book are usually understood when one is reading it but rarely full remembered - reading it again gives you another chance use the lessons in your life.  

This ability to actively tune this factor (similar to tuning the epsilon decay schedule in reinforcement learning) as your life progresses is not immediately obvious - neither is the value of adjusting it.  

Another example of this idea is the choice to travel or settle down.  Both offer a unique set of experiences.  And who said unique experiences was the goal anyway?  

Understanding requires repetition
This is closely related to the previous idea - in fact it’s specifically the deep part.  

I hated Pink Floyd when I first listened to them.  The Beatles did nothing for me when I first heard Sgt Pepper.  Only after multiple listens do 

This can also be interpreted as give things multiple chances.  People, musi.  Your first impression of something is unlikely to be a good representation of how you could ultimately feel about it.  

Mental models from machine learning
There are a number of general themes in modern machine learning I find interesting.  The first is the focus on experimentation.  One of the main criticisms of marine learning is the lack of a theoretical understanding of why algorithms do any don’t learn.  Instead our knowledge is empirical.  

So the focus on experimentation in machine learning is because researcher today have no other options.  Even so I think the power of the experimental approach combined with increased availability of computing power is proving very effective.  Human learning involves a lot of trial and error - it’s like that machine learning will remain experimental for a long time (maybe forever).  

The lack of a theoretical foundation also means that machine learning is usually a very black box approach.  There is an interesting mirror of this in chemical engineering.  When doing heat and mass balances boundaries are drawn around process units.  What goes on inside doesn’t matter - only the heat & mass flows through the boundary.  It’s one reason why I don’t find the black box approach in machine learning uncomfortable.  

Another theme is the power of adversarial algorithms . You can get really good results if you can introduce self play or adversial competition into machine learning.  The power of competition is well documented and evident in both biological evolution and the competitive nature of capitalism.  

***temporal discount factor***

Take advantage of the curse of knowledge when you don’t have it
I’m lucky enough to have been given the opportunity to teach reinforcement learning at Data Science Retreat in Berlin.  I’m not an expert in reinformcent learning, and probably never will be.  But because I can remember what it felt like to have no understanding of the field, it’s actually easier for me to understand what my students might be struggling with.  

If you are starting to get an understanding of something, one of the best things to do is to teach it.  Not only to improve your own understanding, but because you are in a unique position to be able to relate to your student.

Emergence
Emergence is one of the most fascinating phenomena.  It’s the process of properties only occurring when a system gets to a certain size.  Timothy Geithner (former head of the ***) talks about this in his autobiography Stress Test - 

Examples of other emergent phenomena are deterministic Newtonian physics emerging from stochastic quantum physics ***

Principles that don’t scale
Skin in the game book (about political systems that dont scale)

Aligning incentives is important but will not guarantee results
There is no doubt that aligning incentives is a great.  I’ve personally witnessed a massive difference in the performance of my colleagues who were incentivised in different ways.  For example, some site managers would have their bonuses aligned with the energy cost of the site.  Other’s were judged on O&M costs.  Both led to different outcomes.  

The idea of aligning economic incentives is a simple one yet it’s not widely practiced in industry.  Yet only aligning incentives won’t guarantee results.  

But economic incentive is only one motivation behind action.  There are a multitude of other influences that determine behaviour.  The relative effects of all of the influences is variable across people, or even across a single persons lifetime.  If economic incentives were all that mattered then we would find that markets were rational.  In reality both people and markets are often irrational with respect to their own financial interests.

I think this principle applies to the clean energy transition.  Clean energy technologies are showing impressive cost improvements.  In a world with rational economic actors this would be the only thing that mattered.
