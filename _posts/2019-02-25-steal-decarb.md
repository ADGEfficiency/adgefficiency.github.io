This Energy Insights post comes from a recent Intechange podcast [Steal This Decarbonization Plan!](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/steal-this-decarbonization-plan#gs.esosbU3J) with Hal Harvey, who is talking about his excellent new book [Designing Climate Solutions: A Policy Guide for Low-Carbon Energy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Climate-Solutions-Policy-Low-Carbon-ebook/dp/B07KY494ZT/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550535298&sr=8-1&keywords=designing+climate+solutions+policy+guide)

## Good policy

Good policy is composed of:

- stable, long term goals that don't rely on repassing legislation
- rates of change, not fixed targets
- prices where consumers are price sensitive (i.e. industry)
- don't set prices - use reverse actions to auction the subsidy
- performance standards where consumers aren't price sensitive (i.e. transport)

## Divergent learning curves

**Figure 1 - The costs of solar photovoltaic modules have decreased apace with deployment - Figure 2.1 from [Harvey, Orvis & Rissman - Designing Climate Solutions: A Policy Guide for Low-Carbon Energy](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Designing-Climate-Solutions-Policy-Low-Carbon-ebook/dp/B07KY494ZT/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1550535298&sr=8-1&keywords=designing+climate+solutions+policy+guide)**

Harvey defines a learning curve as how fast prices drop as volume increases.  Interestingly, Harvey notes that while component costs in solar and batteries have reduced significantly, much slower progress has been made on system prices.  There is also variance in system costs across regions - with Germany being half of the US!

## Methane - the quick fix

Methane leaks are a large and immediate climate change problem - a leak of only 3-4% makes gas as bad as coal!  It's also an easy fix - it's a plumbing problem.

## Better than batteries

While storage will be crucial in the decarbonization journey, interconnection and demand side response as seen as quicker wins.  Interconnecting markets that are already physically connected is an esepcially quick win.
