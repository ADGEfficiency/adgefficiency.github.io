This Energy Insights posts summarizes a recent episode of the [Greentech Media Interchange podcast](https://www.greentechmedia.com/podcast/the-interchange).  The show discusses the [State of Energy Storage in America](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/the-state-of-americas-energy-storage-market#gs.I72jnh4).  It’s full of interesting insights into what’s going on right now with energy storage.  Below are my notes from the show.

- In 2017 the US deployed around 700 MWh of battery storage. This corresponds to around 300 MW. This is a useful ratio to understand – the ratio of capacity to rate of charge/discharge. I think a useful rule of thumb could be around 2:1 (capacity : rate).

- Smart meter deployment is sitting at around 50% in the US. Unlocking value of these smart meters requires smarter pricing (i.e. time of use).

- Battery storage penetration depends both on technology and regulation. Regulation needs to support cost reflective and variable pricing.

- Disappearance of gas peaking plants hurts gas turbine suppliers more than gas suppliers. Peaking units don’t consume a large amount of gas, they do consume a large amount of capital.

- Importance of considering total project costs for batteries. Cost of battery storage technology is decreasing faster than balance of plant costs.

- The 2016 Southern California Gas company Advanced Energy Storage Impact report notes that commercial energy storage actually increased emissions by 726 tC in 2016. *The main reason for this is the misalignment of incentives*. The customer demand charges are not aligned with the carbon intensity of the grid.

- As an industry we should demand that the upstream supply chains are run without child labour. Cobalt is a material used in battery storage today that involves too much child labour.

Thanks for reading!
