I'm giving a short talk about my [World Models reimplementation](https://adgefficiency.com/world-models/) tomorrow (June 30th 2020, 1700 CET).

The talk will give an introduction to the vision, memory and control components of the World Models agent, a deep dive into the codebase and a summary of lessons learnt.

The talk will be [streamed on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/climatecode) on June 30th 2020, 1700 CET.
