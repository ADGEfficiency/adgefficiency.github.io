I'm hosting my first [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/) community/demo/talent day on September 24th in Berlin.

I'll be giving an update on our work in my four months as Director and introducing the projects of the latest batch of DSR graduates.  I'll also be giving a talk based on my latest post [Mistakes data scientists make](https://adgefficiency.com/mistakes-data-scientist/).

[You can sign up to attend the event on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Community-Day/).  Hope to see some of you there!

## Update 

[My blog post was well received by reddit!](https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/d5nfjc/mistakes_data_scientists_make/):

I'm very lucky to be able to share my work with the world.

A warm thanks also to the great community who supported DSR at our September Talent Day!
