I'm hosting my first [Data Science Retreat](https://datascienceretreat.com/) community/demo/talent day on September 24th in Berlin.

I'll be giving an update on our work in my four months as Director and introducing the projects of the latest batch of DSR graduates.  I'll also be giving a talk based on my latest post [Mistakes data scienists make](https://adgefficiency.com/mistakes-data-scientist/) - I'll be keeping materials used in this talk in

[You can sign up to attend the event on Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/Data-Science-Community-Day/).  Hope to see some of you there!
