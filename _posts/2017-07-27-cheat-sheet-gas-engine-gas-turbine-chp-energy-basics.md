Technical modeling of combined heat & power (CHP) plants was my first area of professional specalization.

At ENGIE I developed technical models to supporting new projects.  I also developed models to optimize the dispatch of existing plants, such as the Olympic Park district heating scheme in London.

CHP **maximizes the recovery of heat & electricity from fuel**. The technologies are mature and will [deliver carbon benefits in most electricity grids](http://adgefficiency.com/does-combined-heat-power-provide-a-carbon-benefit/).

This post aims to give **concise practical details** about the two most commons forms of gas based CHP. Together the gas engine and gas turbine are around 90 % of installed capacity of CHP in the UK.

This post focuses on the technical facts important to the design and operation of gas turbines and gas engines.

## common for both gas engines & gas turbines

- Both have total efficiencies (electric + thermal) roughly around 80 % HHV
- Both operate with a maximum electric efficiency at full load
- In part load operation total efficiency remains around 80 % HHV - reductions in electric efficiency are counteracted by increases in thermal efficiency

## gas engines

**Figure 1 - a simple gas engine schematic**

### key practical advantages

* High electric efficiency (30-38 % HHV)
* Cheap maintenance cost
* Cheap capital cost

### key practical disadvantages

* Half of the recoverable heat is generated as low quality (<100 °C)
* Usually only economic at sizes below 5 MWe

A gas engine generates roughly the same amount of electricity and heat - i.e. the heat to power ratio is around 1:1.

**The recoverable heat generated in a gas engine is split roughly half high grade (>500 °C), half low grade (<100 °C).**

Gas engines are typically economic up until 5-6 MWe.  Beyond that size gas turbines become competitive.

Gas engine CHP is low maintenance (`0.6 - 1.2 p/kWh @ 8,000 hours/yr`) and captial (`500 - 1,500 /kWe total project`) cost.

Having half of the heat generated as low quality means that a low-grade heat sink is required.

Many industrial processes only require high-temperature heat (typically served using steam). **Without a low-grade heat sink for the low-grade heat the economics of a gas engine will suffer.**

Typical low-grade heat sinks include space heating, boiler feedwater heating on sites with low condensate return rates and low-temperature process heating. This makes district heating and hospitals good applications of gas engine CHP.

## gas turbines

**Figure 2 - a simple gas turbine schematic**

### key practical advantages

* All of the heat generated is high quality
* Supplementary firing can be used to generate more heat at high efficiency
* Potential to combine with steam turbines to generate more power

### key practical disadvantages

* Lower electric efficiency
* Complex emissions control systems
* Usually limited to sizes above 5 MWe

A gas turbine operates with a lower electric efficiency (25-35% HHV) than a gas engine.

A gas turbine generates roughly twice as much heat as power - ie the heat to power ratio is around 2:1.

Unlike a gas engine, all of the heat generated by a gas turbine is high grade (>500 C).  This makes gas turbines ideal for industrial sites that need high-temperature steam to run their processes.

This also allows gas turbines to be used in combined cycle mode (steam is generated off the exhaust and used to drive a steam turbine).  More gas can be fired into the exhaust to further increase steam generation (known as supplementary firing).

This can be a key advantage of gas turbines, as the marginal efficiency of supplementary firing is higher than generating heat in a shell or water tube boiler.
