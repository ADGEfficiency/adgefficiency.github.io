**clean up electricity** - high quality renewable energy can be substituted into transport and heating 

**stop building coal generation or mines** - we don't need either of them

**pray for China** - the world leader in renewable capacity growth

**deploy storage** - batteries and demand flexibility to smooth intermittent renewable

**digitize** - the energy industry is behind on installing sensors and collecting data

**tax carbon** - an externality that can be neutrally priced into marginal energy costs

**subsidize** - renewables can't ride of on low interest rates forever

**lifestyle choices** - diet and flying have major carbon impacts

The most important will be your lifestyle choices.
