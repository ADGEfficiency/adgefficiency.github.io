Artifical intelligence is finding it's way into everything.  Whether you know it or not, artificial intelligence changes your life everyday, and it's infulence is likely to increase in the future.

The promise and potential of artificial intelligence is nothing new.  Early pioneers of computer science in the 1940s were just as aware of it's potential as we are today.  So what's been going on in the last few years that is causing all the hype?

This post introduces what modern machine learning is, whats driving performance and highlights some of the challenges facing the field today.  [The second post covers specific applications of machine learning in energy, such as time series forecasting or disaggregation](http://adgefficiency.com/machine-learning-in-energy-part-two/).

## what is machine learning 

The progress in modern artifical intelligence comes from **deep learning** - multiple layer artifical neural networks, whose structure is inspired by the biological neural networks in our own brain.   

What's exciting about neural networks is that they **learn**.  They aren't the only algorithms that can learn - together with algorithms such as logistic regression, random forests and support vector machines they form a family of techniques known as **machine learning**.

This heirarchy is important.  Artificial intelligence encompasses a lot more than just deep learning.  It's possible to be a machine learning practioner and not know much about other artifical intelligence techniques.  Most of the time when companies advertize they are using artifical intelligence, they really mean machine learning.

## learning what we can't 

Machine learning is a family of algorithms that **learn patterns in data**.  In contrast to traditional computer science where a human would tell a machine what to do, machine learning models figure out solutions for themselves.

This is a major paradigm shift.  Steve Juvertson (a venture capitalist who finished an eelectrical engineering degree at Stanford in 2 years!) thinks that "... machine learning is the biggest advance in how we can do engineering since the scientific method...".  

The ability to learn allows machine learning models to **exceed human performance in a variety of domains**.  Deep learning has blown past the previous state of the art in fundamental computer science problems such as computer vision and natural language understanding.

This ability of machine learning to generalize across different fundamental problems also allows machine learning models to **generalize across different industries**.  It's hard to think of a vertical industry that machine learning won't transform.

The paradigm shift of machine learning can be demonstrated by comparing two landmark achievements in artifical intelligence - IBM's Deep Blue and Alphabet/Google/DeepMind's AlphaGo.

In 1996 IBM's Deep Blue defeated World Chess Champion Gary Kasparov. IBMs Deep Blue derived it's playing strength from brute force computing power. All of Deep Blue's intelligence originated from a team of programmers and chess Grandmasters, who handcrafted moves into the machine.  

In 2016 Alphabet's AlphaGo defeated Go legend Lee Sedol 4-1. AlphaGo was not given any information about Go stragety from its programmers. Alpha Go used reinforcement learning to learn from its own actions and experience. **Machine learning allowed AlphaGo to learn on it's own, and become better than any human will ever be at the game of Go**.

One of the features of AlphaGo is how the game of Go was presented to AlphaGo.  The model was fed the positions of the stones on the board in it's raw form. This ability to learn from the raw structure of the world is fundamental to modern machine learning.
