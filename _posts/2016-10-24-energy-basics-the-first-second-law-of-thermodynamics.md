The First and Second Law are foundational in energy engineering.

They are also so simple they can be stated in two sentences.

**one** - the First Law says you can only ever break even.

**two** - the Second Law says you will never break even, and will always lose!

## First Law of Thermodynamics

The First Law is about conservation.  Energy can never be created or destroyed.  We can only convert energy from one form to another.  

A common energy transformation is converting fuel into power and heat.

The practical implication of the First Law are mass & energy balances.  Engineers use balances to understand and model energy systems.  Unknowns such as flow rates of water or temperatures of gases can be calculated using balances.

A simple example of power generation â€“ we generate 4 units of power from 10 units of fuel.  The First Law allows us to calculate the heat generation at 6 units.

The First Law limits the amount of power generation at 10.  The Second Law further limits how much power we can generate.

## Second Law of Thermodynamics

The Second Law has multiple forms.  The Second Law limits how much power we can generate from fuel. No matter how advanced our technology becomes we will never be able to convert 100% of our fuel into power.

There are fundamental thermodynamic limits on the amount of high quality energy we can convert from one form to another.  Conversion of energy always results in a loss of energy quality.  When generating electricity we will always end up with some of our fuel converted into low quality energy (i.e. heat).

The Second Law tells us that heat is a necessary by-product of power generation. To maximize the value we get from our fuel requires finding a place for this heat. Combined Heat and Power attempts to make use of this heat in industry or for heating.

The First Law tells us we can only ever break even when converting energy.  The Second Law then tells us we will always lose!

Both of these Laws have alternative definitions and interpretations.  The insights I have chosen to highlight above are the two I find the most practical.
