> When we raise money it's AI, when we hire it's machine learning, and when we do the work it's logistic regression - JUAN MIGUEL LAVISTA

The last ten years have witnessed outstanding progress in artificial intelligence (AI). 

The state of the art on a wide range of challenging problems are powered by a specific branch of AI - machine learning.

**Yet alongside real progress inevitably comes fakes, scammers and charlatans.**  How can we spot these people?  How can we make sure we don't turn into one?

One indicator of machine learning charlatan is using technical terms like artificial intelligence, machine learning or deep learning interchangeably.  **They are not the same thing!**

Clumsily mixing up these terms is a sign that someone is not experienced - or even worse, that they are intentionally trying to mislead you - commonly to get you to invest in their startup.

**This post will clarify three foundational concepts - AI, machine learning and deep learning** - what they are and how they relate to each other.


<br />

# Artificial Intelligence

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the field of creating intelligent machines that can solve problems.

This section will answer the following:

- what is AI?
- what is intelligence?
- the difference between competence and comprehension
- the difference between rules & learning


## What is AI?

Making intelligent machines has been a dream of humanity since antiquity.

Much of the foundation of modern, digital AI were laid by Alan Turing - one foundation being a proof that any form of computation could be described in digital form - the Turing Machine.

<center><figcaption>Turing's 1936 paper On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem</figcaption></center>

<br />

The 1950's then saw the rise of the digital computer, and with it the first attempts to create electronic brains.

So what then is artificial intelligence? Artificial is easy - it means man-made.  AI can be either hardware (such as a robot) or software (such as a recommendation algorithm) or a combination of both.

**Intelligence however, is harder to define.**


## What is intelligence?

Intelligence - you know when you see it - but formal definitions escape us. Below we will look at intelligence by making two comparisons:

- competence versus comprehension - being able to do versus being able to understand
- rules versus learning


## Competence versus comprehension

The first perspective we will look at is a decomposition of intelligence into competence & comprehension:

- **competence being the ability to perform a task well**
- **comprehension being the ability to understand a task**

Take the example of operating an elevator.  Historically this was done using human operators, who had both competence (to operate the elevator safely & efficiently) and comprehension (they understood what an elevator was, what their role was, who the passengers were etc).

Now elevators are operated by machines - rule based, automated systems.  These systems are competent (more competent than human operators), but lack comprehension about the task they perform.

The machine elevator operator is a rule based system - human designed but operated without human input. **If we consider competence alone to be sufficient for intelligence, then many machines we live and work with today can be considered intelligent - including your elevator.**

Many energy industry professionals will be familiar with the programmable logic controller (PLC) - a simple device responsible for controlling over 95% of industrial systems on the planet.  These systems are competent - but are they intelligent?

**Given a broader definition of intelligence, AI has been here for a while, in the form of rule based automation.** 

But rule based automation is not the only approach to AI - there are multiple approaches to creating intelligent machines. 

In order to understand the relationship between AI and machine learning, we will introduce our second perspective of AI - that of rule based versus learning systems.


## Rules versus learning

A second way to look at intelligence is to compare rules with learning. **A defining feature of rule based systems is that they are human designed** -  human programmers need design them.

The dependency on human design can make rule based systems expensive, and can limit performance to human levels. Human design does however have benefits - rules can be explained and interpreted.

Are rules, defined and executed in a computer program, artificial intelligence?

For humans, the ability to learn is key to our claim to intelligence.  Learning allows us to use our experience to solve ever more complex problems. For artificial systems, learning removes the dependency on the human programmer and introduces a dependency on data.

We can further look at these two approaches, rules versus learning, by comparing two landmark achievements in AI - the first superhuman computers to play Go and chess.


## Case study - rules vs. learning - DeepBlue vs. AlphaGo

A crown jewel of modern artificial intelligence is the 2016 AlphaGo victory over Lee Sedol.  Go was the last great challenge for AI in board games - **creating a superhuman Go computer was thought to be a decade away.**

AlphaGo was a machine learning system - it learnt to play the game of Go by learning from data.

![]({{ '/assets/ml_energy/alphago.jpg' }})

*Lee Sedol in his eventual 4-1 loss to AlphaGo*

The AlphaGo approach stands in contrast to Deep Blue, the computer that solved chess with a 1996 victory over Garay Kasparov.  All of Deep Blue's intelligence originated from a team of programmers and chess Grandmasters, who handcrafted moves into the machine.

# Machine learning

> Machine learning is the biggest advance in how we can do engineering since the scientific method - Steve Juvertson

Machine learning is a family of AI approaches where machines learn from data. 

In this section will answer the following:

- what are the three ingredients of machine learning?
- what are the three branches of machine learning?
- how does machine learning learn?
- what do machine learning models do?

Throughout this section we will use a case study of a fictional energy company EnergyCo to help explain how machine learning can be used on energy industry datasets and problems.


## Three ingredients of machine learning

Machine learning has three ingredients - data, compute and algorithms:

<center>
  <code>machine learning = data + compute + algorithms</code>
</center>
<p></p>

These three ingredients explain why machine learning has progressed so far in the last decade.

The rise of the internet has led to a vast increase in how much data is being generated - from sensors on wind turbines to photos on your smart phone, we now generate and collect more data than every before.

Alongside this our ability to perform more computation at cheaper prices continues to improve.  For machine learning, a key innovation was repurposing graphical processing units (GPUs), originally designed for gaming, to train neural networks.

Finally, innovation has continued on the algorithm side, with researchers developing and improving the programs and models used in machine learning.

Compute and algorithms are widely available - massive amounts of compute can be purchased on the cloud, and almost all machine learning research and tooling is freely available on arxiv or GitHub.

**Because of this democratization of compute and algorithms, data becomes the most important factor in getting machine learning to work.**  

Aside from branding, the collection of unique datasets is the only way technology companies can defend their businesses.



## I have data - what machine learning can we do on it?

How we can apply machine learning to a dataset depends on multiple factors. Some of the most important are:

- what kind of data you have,
- the amount of data you have,
- how clean the data is,
- how stationary the data is,
- if the data has seasonality,
- if the data has a trend.

Because data is so important to machine learning, we will begin our look at machine learning with a case study on the kind of data an energy retailer can collect, and how we can apply machine learning to it.


## Case Study - Energy Customer Data

Three common types of data generated in the energy industry are:

- tabular data
- time series data
- decision data

This case study looks at how a fictional energy retailer EnergyCo generates these three kinds of data.


## Tabular data

Tabular data will be familiar to anyone who has spent time in Excel - data organized into rows and columns. Each row represents a sample of data, each column represents a feature or characteristic of each sample.

A key feature of tabular data is that the order doesn't matter - each sample is independent of each other sample.

An example of tabular data EnergyCo would collect would be where the customer lives or when they signed up:

| Name | Address         | Contract Start |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| Bill | 123 Fake Street | 2016-01-01     |
| Jane | 321 Real Lane   | 2016-01-15     |


## Time series data

Time series data looks very similar to tabular data - the key difference is that now there a temporal (time) component to the data.  This temporal component gives the data an ordinal structure - each sample is linked by time to a sample that occurred before and after it.

An example of time series data would be the monthly energy consumption of these customers:

| Month   | Name | Consumption |
|---------|------|-------------|
| 2016-01 | Bill | 116.8       |
| 2016-02 | Bill | 204.3       |
| 2016-01 | Jane | 50.4        |
| 2016-02 | Jane | 311.0       |


## Decision data

Decision data involves action - something was chosen (either by a human or machine) that changed the data seen afterwards (known as path dependency).

An example of decision data would be the data collected by EnergyCo's customer support team:

| Timestamp  | Customer Name | Reason for call  | Action                  |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|
| 2016-01-03 | Bill          | Invoice too high | Reissue invoice         |
| 2016-02-15 | Jane          | Invoice late     | Update customer address |

Now that we have examples of what kind of data EnergyCo collects, we can look at how to apply machine learning to these datasets.


## The three branches of machine learning

Machine learning can be separated into three branches, based on the signal available to the learner:

- supervised learning
- unsupervised learning
- reinforcement learning

These three branches correspond to the tasks commonly done by machine learning:

- predicting with supervised learning
- generating data with unsupervised learning
- making decisions with reinforcement learning

Below we will look at how each of these three branches relate to data collected by EnergyCo.


## Branch 1 - Supervised learning

The first branch is **supervised learning**, where labelled training data is to learn how to predict the labels of unseen data. 

Examples include time series forecasting, computer vision and language translation.  For our EnergyCo dataset, supervised learning would predict the monthly consumption of our customers.

For the dataset below we have labels for all our samples except the last one:

| Month     | Name   | Consumption   | Predicted Consumption |
| --------- | ------ | ------------- | --------------------- |
| 2016-01   | Bill   | 116.8         | 115.4                 |
| 2016-02   | Bill   | 204.3         | 202.0                 |
| 2016-03   | Bill   | ???           | 250.6                 |
| 2016-01   | Jane   | 50.4          | 45.9                  |
| 2016-02   | Jane   | 311.0         | 305.1                 |
| 2016-03   | Jane   | ???           | 315.9                 |


## Branch 2 - Unsupervised learning

The second branch is **unsupervised learning**, where new data is generated without the supervision of labels.

An example of applying unsupervised learning to our EnergyCo dataset would be clustering - grouping customers based on structure learnt in the data:

| Name   | Address           | Contract Start   | Cluster |
| ------ | ----------------- | ---------------- | ------- |
| Bill   | 123 Fake Street   | 2016-01-01       | 1       |
| Jane   | 321 Real Lane     | 2016-01-15       | 2       |
| Jill   | 123 Actual Place     | 2016-01-20       | 2       |

Our clustering algorithm has determined that that Jane & Jill belong to the same cluster - indicating that these customers are similar.


## Branch 3 - Reinforcement learning

Reinforcement learning is the branch of machine learning associated with decision making. In reinforcement learning the machine learns to select actions with the supervision of a scalar reward signal.

For our EnergyCo dataset, reinforcement learning would be able to select the best action that our customer service team should take:

| Timestamp  | Customer Name | Reason for call  | Taken action            | Best Action          |
|------------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------|----------------------|
| 2016-01-03 | Bill          | Invoice too high | Reissue invoice         | Recalculate balance  |
| 2016-02-15 | Jane          | Invoice late     | Update customer address | Check credit history |


## How does machine learning work?

Above we have looked at examples of data generated in the energy industry, and how the three branches of machine learning (supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement) can be used with these datasets.  **But how does machine learning actually work?**

In this section we will answer the question - how machine learning algorithms are able to learn.


## Learning by trial and error from data

Fundamentally, machine learning algorithms learn through trial and error.

A model is trained in successive steps, each time learning how to perform better by learning from it's mistakes:

1. get some data
2. make predictions on that data
3. compare your predictions with the target to create an error signal
4. use the error signal to improve
5. repeat steps 2-5

![fig1]({{ '/assets/ml_energy/nn_black_box.png' }})

<figcaption>One iteration of training for a machine learning model predicting wind turbine power output from weather data</figcaption>

It's really that simple!


## Testing on unseen data

All of this learning occurs on training data - data that the model can learn from.  

**All data contains a combination of signal and noise** - a model can perform well on training data arbitrarily well by fitting to this noise, or memorizing it.  Overcoming overfitting is perhaps the central challenge in machine learning.

To combat overfitting, after training the performance of a model is measure on unseen data, known as test or holdout data.  Models that are able to perform on unseen data are said to have generalized - to have learnt meaningful patterns that will hold on data in the future.


## Useful high level perspectives on machine learning

Above we looked at how machine learning works:

- learn by trial and error from data
- test performance on unseen data

We will finish our look at machine learning with a few of high level perspectives on the what of machine learning - what machine learning is doing.


## Pattern recognition

All machine learning involves pattern recognition.  Returning to our three branches, the patterns being learnt are:

- supervised learning is learning how the features relate to the target
- unsupervised learning is learning patterns of the features alone
- reinforcement learning learns the pattern of how actions lead to rewards

As mentioned above in our section on testing, it's important that the patterns being learnt are signal - not noise.


## Programming without programming

A second useful perspective on machine learning is programming without programming - also known as [Software 2.0](https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35).

Machine learning can be seen as a fundamental change in how we do programming - instead of having to explicitly program behaviour, programming is done by giving a machine data - examples of the patterns we want to learn or the behaviour we want to achieve.


## Dimensionality reduction

> Intuition in n-dimensions isn't worth a dam - GEORGE DANZIG

Reducing a high dimensional sample of data to a lower dimension is a fundamental process in machine learning.

Low dimensional representations of high dimensional data are valuable because business decisions are made in low dimensional spaces.


## Function approximation

The final perspective on machine learning is one of function approximation.

A function is simple - input goes in and output comes out. The reason this is a useful perspective on machine learning is that functions are what we learn in machine learning.

Often these functions are complex, such as:

- image pixels to text
- weather data to wind turbine power output
- predicting the next word in a sentence


<br />
# Deep learning

The final of our three concepts is deep learning.  The last ten years have been the deep learning era in AI - deep learning has driven much of the outstanding progress and hype across a wide range of challenging problems.

Computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning have all been revolutionized by deep learning.

In this section you will learn:

- what is deep learning?
- what is a neural network?
- what tasks does deep learning perform well on?


## What is deep learning?

Deep learning is a branch of machine learning based on artificial neural networks.  Artificial neural networks are a class of models inspired by the biological neural networks in our brains.

Artificial neural networks are simpler than their biological counterparts.  Yet even though they don't replicate the complexity of the brain, artificial neural networks are driving much of the progress in modern artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The fundamental building block of a neural network is the artificial neuron.  Many of these neurons together form a layer - these layers can then be stacked in a sequence.  This is where the deep in deep learning comes from - multiple layers of neurons connected to each other.

Neural networks are exciting for a number of reasons.  One is their similarity to our own brains, hinting that this architecture can take us all the way to superhuman, general AI.

## How does deep learning fit with the three branches of machine learning?

Deep learning offers a class of functions - neural networks. 

A neural network is like any other function - it takes some input and produces an output. 

These neural networks can be used as components of any of our three machine learning branches, to create:

- deep supervised learning
- deep unsupervised learning
- deep reinforcement learning


## What tasks does deep learning perform well on?

The major benefit of deep learning is that performance scales with data - something that isn't true of classical machine learning.

![fig3]({{ '/assets/ml_energy/fig2.png' }})

*Deep neural networks are able to learn from massive amounts of data  - [adapted from 'AI is the New Electricity' (Andrew Ng)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21EiKfQYZXc)*

This ability to scale with data is also a weakness - deep learning requires a lot of data.

While deep learning is undeniably amazing, it is not state of the art on all tasks.  On a wide range of tabular data problems, classical machine learning (namely gradient boosted decision trees) reign supreme.  Many business problems are tabular data problems - making deep learning less useful in many industries than the hype suggests.

Deep learning excels when there is structure in data - data such as images, audio or text all have structure that neural networks can be built to exploit:

- images = spatial structure - height, width and depth
- audio = temporal structure
- text = syntatic or grammatical structure

- artificial intelligence = creating intelligent machines that can solve problems
- machine learning = a branch of AI, where machines learn from data
