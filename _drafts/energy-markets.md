Buying and selling energy

There are a myriad of different commercial constructs that can be used in energy projects to represent the relationship between the buyer and the seller of energy and/or to help hedge, finance or de-risk parts of the project.

Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs): 

Put simply, PPAs represent the way you sell the power that you produce. In Gridcog, assets that can earn PPAs are renewable generators such as wind and solar sites and Generators sell the power they produce via a number of different structures.

PPAs can be purely financial or linked to physical energy flows. A physical PPA can either be a private wire arrangement, which could be based on consumption or total generation, or they can be market facing, for example where the PPA offtaker registers your MPAN/NMI/meter and pays you for every MWh of energy that is exported through it.

Physical PPA prices are usually fixed across different time periods (e.g. summer/winter), may be referenced to a certain market index (e.g. N2EX Day Ahead) or be priced across a combination of these markets. Usually PPAs will include a fixed or passthrough element for non-power benefits including green certificates, subsidy schemes and embedded benefits. 

PPA offtakers can vary quite considerably but may include retailers, suppliers, aggregators or landlords in private wire arrangements. If you’re interested in learning more about PPAs we’ve included a deeper look into some common PPA structures at the bottom of this article. 

Supply Agreements/Retail Tariffs: 

These are arrangements for the purchase of electricity from your Supplier or Retailer. Like PPAs they will usually include a fixed or floating price represented in $ or £/MWh for the power you consume - this price is likely to vary depending on the time of day that you consume power, known as a Time of Use (TOU) tariff structure. Retail tariffs are likely to include non-commodity charges as well, these will be represented as a fixed or percentage passthrough cost, if they are a passthrough your bill will likely include an estimate of what they will be. Non-commodity charges include things like Standing charges, RO/CfD, RCRC, BSuOS.

Optimisation Agreements: 

Flexible generation assets, such as batteries, gas peakers, flexible plant or electric vehicle fleets enabled for vehicle-to-grid (V2G) will likely be contracted via optimisation agreements rather than PPAs or Supply Arrangements. We’re also starting to see renewable assets enter into optimisation agreements alongside their PPAs, usually with the same party; this is to manage their participation in balancing or curtailment markets. 

Optimisation agreements are common commercial structures for flexible assets because a flat £ or $/MWh rate is unlikely to represent the most optimal value from the flexibility these assets can provide. Normally optimisation agreements are structured as a revenue share (also known as merchant structure) whereby an optimiser or flexibility provider takes a certain percentage of all profits earned for providing market access and trading services; this is useful as it keeps the incentives of the flexibility provider and asset owner aligned. 

In some cases, particularly for large assets, floors or tolls may be contracted instead of a revenue share arrangement. These are where the flexibility provider provides some guarantee of revenue (normally annualised) in exchange for a higher upside above the guaranteed level; these structures can be useful for people pursuing specific financing arrangements for their assets. 
Financing energy assets

Most commonly one party (i.e. the Developer/Customer) will be financing the energy assets and covering their capex costs. However, increasingly we are seeing more hybrid financing models arise; these include lease arrangements between suppliers and customers, landlords financing PV systems and selling excess generation to tenants, community battery projects and rent-a-roof solar systems. In these scenarios the capex cost could be spread across multiple parties or one party could be seeking to recover their investment via a PPA, Lease or Optimisation Agreement. 

Additionally, some Gridcog clients model cashflows for financiers and investors who are providing financing to allow them to invest in energy projects. Understanding these cash flows and how they change over time can be vital when building an investment case.
