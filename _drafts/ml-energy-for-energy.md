## Importance of data

The most important part of any machine learning project is the data - energy machine learning projects are no different.

Data is the fuel of machine learning - no matter how powerful an engine, fuel is required to make it work.

A common form of data in energy is time series data (often called interval data).  

Energy professionals will already be familiar with the importance of time - energy demand and prices all depend heavily on the time of day, day of week and month of the year.

Data quality is not only about quantity of data.  More data is almost always better (because you can choose not to use it), but data quantity is not the only thing to get right.

In addition to the amount of data, data quality is important.  Alongside common data quality issues such as missing values or duplicates, time series data quality is dependent on seasonality and stationarity.

Seasonality is the regular, cyclic patterns in time series data. Energy time series data often exhibits multiple levels of seasonality:

- monthly,
- weekly,
- daily.

Stationarity refers to whether a time series is fundamentally changing or not.  A more technical way to describe a non-stationary time series is to say that the data generating process has changed.

A good example of this is the Australian electricity market switching from 30 minute settlement to 5 minute settlement.  This kind of fundamental change in the market structure

More examples of a non-stationary time series?  Any energy system undergoing a transition to renewables, or a warming planet.


## What can machine learning do?

If you aren't familiar with ML -> [AI, Machine Learning and Deep Learning ](https://adgefficiency.com/ai-ml-dl/).

It's always important to remember that the value of data is more than only machine learning.

For many business problems, doing putting data into a database and doing analytics is enough to provide value.  If this is the case for you - lucky you!

It's important to maximize the value of data - data can often be used in many different ways - machine learning is only one.

Two common uses of machine learning are prediction and control.

The first group of tasks machine learning excels at is prediction.

Examples of using machine learning for prediction in energy include:
- forecasting 

Another group of tasks machine learning excels at is control.

Examples of using machine learning for control in energy include:
- batteries
- data centers

## Not a silver bullet

> The data may not contain the answer - JOHN TUKEY

Despite investors, AI/ML is not solution to everything

Data = more than ML

Marginal gains in some areas - unlikely to revolutionize anything

Expectation management

The unfortunate truth for technical people is that the climate problem is much larger than technology 

- policy (carbon tax) still remains the most powerfurl and most underutilized tool we have

For many businesses, both economic and environmental gains can occur with the implementation of automation or basic data collection.

Futures that are difficult to imagine:

- a 100% robot operated power station

Possibilities that are open today:

- use deep learning for prediction
