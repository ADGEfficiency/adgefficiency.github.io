# What I want machine learning people to know

## The energy transition

The energy industry is defined by transitions.  

Our current energy transitions is towards distributed, small scale and intermittent renewable generation.

The intermittent side introduces uncertainty on generatiors

The distributed nature introduces uncertainty on the demand side along with a higher dimensional action space.

More challenging control problems - storage, flexible demand - on top of a vast number of existing control 



## Importance of time + sequence models

- lots of data, but much still not digitized (5 min frequency)

Time important in energy

Applying attention is a goldmine

- heavy seasonality & trends (non stationary)


## Availability of cost functions

One of the best things about working in energy is the availability of cost functions. 

Technical people in energy are lucky to have access to cost functions that they can calculate (or at least estimate) - two of the most useful cost functions are money and carbon.

The importance of a cost function won't be lost on machine learning people - optimizing a cost function is how neural networks learn.

Compare energy to domains such as driving or language - which lack clear cost functions.  It is not trivial on how to quantify:

- the quality of driving (taking into account speed and safety),
- the quality of speech (taking into account clarity and accuracy),
- the quality of government policy.

Energy is lucky because we have good cost functions that can be quantified that correlate well with what businesses want (more money or less carbon).

Businesses are naturally focused on money - the only hope for proper carbon optimization is a carbon tax.
