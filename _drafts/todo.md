# A Review of Planet of the Humans - Energy Insights

I recently watched !! by !!.  

It is clear that the director !! has his credentials, with decades of involvement in the environmental movement.



For most of the film I thought the main point was that wind, solar and storage are unlikely to be the full technical solution.

I propose that the core message of the film is actually that there are elements of the environmental movement (Al Gore & !! Blood) that are putting money before the environment.  

Alongside this core message are a number of sub messages, many of which support the main argument:
- wind & solar still require fossil fuels
- wind & solar are not enough
- biomass is immoral
- overpopulation is a root cause of 

## What is this film about

Not just about climate change

calling out corn ethanol = great
- criticism of Al Gore is rather scathing, but it's not suprising
- mistakes are not a scandal


## Reliance of renewables on fossil fuels

Production
- reliance of solar on coal
- real question is NOT do w/s require fossil, but rather if that amout of carbon is acceptable?

Operation
- where the kWh come from


## Reliance of renewables on the weather

Solar panels not working at a rainy festival in Vermont

Solar panel inefficiency

Tesla factory with a grid connection

## Wind and solar aren't good enough

12 year old panels & poorly maintained solar tower plants are not proof that renewables have excessive maintenance cost or short lifetimes.

Many gas fired CHP plants are designed with a ten year lifetime of the prime mover, before a major overhaul.  This overhaul can either be done in place, or it may be cheaper to replace and do the maintenance offsite.

8 % efficiency panels

Electric cars

Intermittency, land area use, second order effects of production

## Biomass

Different types of biomass

Competition with food

## Overpopulation

> the first animal (we know of) to intentionally limit it's own existence

overpopulation is the natural order

too many human beings, using too much, too fast

Consumption (per captia)

cruel, evil and racist ideology (because pop growth in developing world)

## Criticisms

### Not being clear about renewable versus sustainable

no material is renewable

### Renewables don't replace fossil fuels

> As can be seen clearly in Fig. 2, historically, no established energy source has undergone a sustained decline with the addition of a new energy source. Rather, consumption of all energy sources has typically grown, a trend that has been maintained for over two centuries

This is true - renewables often only make up for the growth.

### Transportation & heating, nuclear, CCS

### Carbon credits

Where is the criticism?

### Data visulaization

- min 28 - misleading
- min 30 = storage chat starts, some misleading criticism

horrible drawing of the small size of the storage market

min 44 = great design for a chart

### Greta

Perhaps the most interesting omission is the lack of a Greta Thunburg mention.

### No solution

This isn't really a critisism - I like it

So what is this film?  It's a tragic rally call that you hear once the battle is over.  Everyone knows it.  

Second film I've watched on YouTube - first was AlphaGo.  

I doubt ! will ever make a film again.  This film

The point of this film is not to derail the environmental course - it is to correct course.

Women's education

### Targeting your own

> to organize, to build power, to bring people together. That’s the real, and difficult, work — not purity tests or calling people out, but calling them in



## Conclusion

My final thought is a strong recommend - I can't think of
