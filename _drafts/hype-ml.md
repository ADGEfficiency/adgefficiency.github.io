Hype
- ml revolution in computing
- AI to investors
- ml solving many problems in other industries

What we have today is alot
- data driven, trial & error learning, just what we have today is amazing


## Why are many companies not doing deep learning?

There is more to machine learning than just deep neural networks - algorithms like logistic regression and random forests are suitable for many business problems.      

It's very common for data driven companies doing machine learning at scale to not be using deep learning.

This is because much of the data generated and used by businesses does not suit deep learning - it's tabular data.

The other major constraint is the amount of data, which can be a bottle neck for using deep learning on NLP tasks.


It's very important to point out that deep learning is not the only valuable machine learning approach.  Many data driven businesses are getting massive value from machine learning without doing any deep learning.

Classical machine learning covers a number of different approaches.  The most performant and popular are a family of models based on ensembles of decision trees - most commonly XGBoost.

Classical = more widely used in many industries (esp time series)

- why deep learning is probably not the best ML approach you can take
- why a non-deep learning approach is probably where most of the business value is for your problem


# Is the machine learning hype justified?

The spectre of being an overhyped bubble hangs heavy artificial intelligence - the history of the field is of boom periods of overestimation of the near term potential of AI with periods of no progess - known as AI winters.

Machine learning has allowed computers to demonstrate human level (or above) performance on a range of challenging tasks.  Given enough data and compute, machines are able of learning to do complex tasks.

The question of if the hype in machine learning is justified, needs to be asked in the context of a certain class of problems, or in a certain industry.

The progress made in the last decade is real. Google, Amazon and Facebook all have world class AI labs and much of their business has been transformed by machine learning. The potential of machine learning is more latent in industries that are less digitized (such as healthcare, energy or education).

## What about general AI?

Narrow AI = able to solve a single task at a superhuman level

General AI = broad, able to solve any task at a superhuman level

Some researchers even think it's all we will need to solve the general intelligence problem.  What exactly is needed is unclear, but we are many breakthroughs away from providing general intelligence.  Narrow superhuman machine intelligence is already here.

So far machine learning has provided narrow artificial intelligence (AI).  The power of these systems are often superhuman, and more than enough to justify the hype around machine learning.  Typically the task involves perception, using high dimensional data (i.e. images).  This is the main contribution of machine learning - being able to create business value from raw, high dimensional data.

This narrow intelligence stands in contrast to the goal of many AI researchers - general AI, where a machine can perform a single machine can variety of tasks.  While it is almost certain that machine learning will form part of a general artificial intelligence, much more is needed to provide an intelligent machine that can perform a variety of tasks.
