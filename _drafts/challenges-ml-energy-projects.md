## Same challenges as rest of ML

Uncertantity
- interpretability

Unlearnable patterns

- not enough data, or no labels
- seasonality & trend
- unlearnable patterns - tasks we can't do
- messy data, data that can't be worked on properly (can't be joined - example of this!)
- non-stationary processes, black swans (predicting the US shale gas revolution)


energy = small data
- renewables plant only 2 years old
- combinigc datasets useful
- Poor state of digitization means working with small data is the primary work of energy data scientists
