This post is aimed at two audiences:

- energy professionals wanting to understand how machine learning can solve energy industry problems,
- data professionals wanting to understand how their skills can be used to solve energy problems.

This post has three sections:

1. **state of energy** - where is the energy industry today?
1. **potential** - can machine learning be used to solve energy industry problems?
2. **challenges** - what will prevent a machine learning project being a success?

Core messages for the energy professional:

- the performance of machine learning is driven by data quality,
- ?
- ?

Core messages for the machine learning professional:

- the energy industry still has a way to go in digitization,
- ?
- ?


## Section One - State of Energy


### Not just electricity

Two useful concepts to help understand energy consumption are primary versus final energy:

- primary energy is the total amount of energy available for conversion,
- final energy is the amount of energy actually consumed.

One reason for the difference between primary and final energy are losses incurred during energy production, for example:

- converting coal to electricity occurs at an efficiency of around 60%,
- hydroelectric power generates electricity at an efficiency of around 90%,



### But electricity is where the fun is at

While both primary and final energy are composed of much more than just electricity, electricity is where much of the focus is.

Electricity is a high quality form of energy, that has a variety of final uses.  Other fuels such as biomass are only useful for heating.



### Importance of time


### Distributed, small scale & intermittent







## Section Two - Potential


### Cost functions


### Real, hard problems












## Section Three - Challenges


### Digitization, access


### Small data


### Seasonality, stationarity
