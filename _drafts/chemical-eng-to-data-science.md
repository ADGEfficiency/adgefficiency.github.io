What was easy:

- black box thinking,
- calculus and linear algebra was fine - really only first derivatives

What worked:
- know when to stop

Consider education:

Many data scienctists don't have data science degrees - stats, stem, computer science, lawyers, economists,

Success isn't guaranteed, but it's possible

Projects - link to blog post

Programming wont' be as you expect it

Use domain expertize if you have it
- can be used to limit the amount you need to learn - ie energy is tabular data + time series, some control - include more general chem eng like predictive maintenance

Data eng particularly chem eng minded - scale, cyclic systems, accumulation, rate liming steps

What was hard:

- statistics and probability,

What is just different:

- concept of senior totally different

Where to start

- Python - pandas to replace Excel
- databases and SQLite
- supervised machine learning.

black box thinking - being comfortable with them, understanding what level of abstraction to stop at (ie last, donâ€™t know how internals work exactly, but understand how to connect into other parts of the model, i.e the train data etc)
