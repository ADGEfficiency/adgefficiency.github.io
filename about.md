An energy engineer who loves building things.  I most enjoy building technical models to optimally dispatch energy systems.

My professional mission is to positively contribute to decarbonization.  I’m excited about using machine learning to decarbonize the supply of heat and electricity.   I’m especially excited about reinforcement learning.

I’m happily employed at Tempus Energy, where we are supporting decarbonization by making electricity systems more flexible.
